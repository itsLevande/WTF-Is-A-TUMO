# WTF Is A TUMO?

WTF Is A TUMO? is a simple lua tool created to convert between .tumo and .obj and vice versa.

# How to Use

Either download all files in the repository and follow [LÃ–VE2D's guide](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution) on creating an executable, 
or go to the [releases](https://github.com/itsLevande/WTF-Is-A-TUMO/releases) and download a ready to use executable (windows only).

Once you're in the program, dragging a file/directory into the window is the only step required in order to start the process.

All files will be output to %AppData%\WTF Is A TUMO\.
